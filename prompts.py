        PII: Personally identifiable information (PII) is any information connected to a specific individual that can be used to uncover that individual's identity, such as their social security number, full name, or email address. PII should be removed right after user input message.
        Topical: Ensure the user and bot does not deviate from a specified topic of conversation.
        Consistency: Ensure the consistency of bot's answer by making the bot answer questions twice.
        Factuality: Ensure that the bot's response is accurate and mitigates hallucination issues. You should refer to knowledge base to evaluate the answer.
        Toxicity: Make sure that the bot responses aren't offensive and do not contain swear words.
        Evaluated: Prevent the bot to give answers directly, try to give hint to help users think step by step.
